# CS506-TEMPLATE-base-repo

If your project has multiple teams add changes (code, deliverables, data, etc.) to your team folder.

Create a new branch from your team branch (ex. branch name: <code>sp23-team-1</code>, <code>sp23-team-2</code>,...etc.), add changes to your team folder (on the new branch you just created).

Open a Pull Request to your team branch (ex. branch name: <code>sp23-team-1</code>). Add your PM and TE as reviewers.  ***Do not delete any team folders.***

At the end of the semester during project wrap up open a final Pull Request to <code>dev</code> from your team branch. 

# Add Users
To  add yourself to the repository, open a Pull Request modifying `COLLABORATORS`, entering your GitHub username in a newline.

All Pull Requests must follow the Pull Request Template, with a title formatted like such `[Project Name]: <Descriptive Title>`
