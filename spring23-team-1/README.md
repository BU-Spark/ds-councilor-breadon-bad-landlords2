***Bad Landlords II Team 1***

The purpose of this project is to increase the accessibility and transparency of the Boston planning, zoning, and development process so her constituents and residents across Boston can better understand the evolving landscape of their city. The end goal is to build a trackable system for Boston property violations to then determine which landlords are bad landlords.

We analyzed Boston property data to create visualizations of property and landlord violations. Our main focus was to analyze the number of violations per neighborhood in addition to finding out which landlords commit the most number of violations. For our extension project, we aimed to analyze which social features in particular neighborhoods impacted the severity and number of violations committed by landlords to take advantage of marginalized communities.


Our repository consists of the following directories:<br>
**analysis**: This directory has all the Jupyter notebooks with the data analysis that we did. Each notebook is appropriately named to indicate what type of analysis was done in each file.<br>
**data**: This directory has all the csv and data files that were either found or given to us at the beginning of the project. Again, the files are appropriately named to indicate what data is stored in each respective csv.<br>
**deliverables**: This directory holds all of our checkpoints, reports, presentations, and deliverables as part of the project.

Running the code simply requires running each cell in each Jupyter notebook. The notebooks have all the necessary libraries being imported before they are used. One thing to keep in mind is that different notebooks use different csv files for the data but the file names indicate which dataset is being used.
