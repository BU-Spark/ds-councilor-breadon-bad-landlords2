## Project Summary

In collaboration with councilor Breadon, we are performing data analysis on Boston’s property and renting datasets to determine which landlords in the area are so-called “bad landlords”. The stated aim of the project is to build a trackable system for property violations throughout Boston and create a matrix that determines whether a given landlord is a “bad landlord.” Finding a specific ordinance that can be used to define a threshold for a “bad landlord” was also a stated goal of the project. The overall motivation and impact of the project is to increase transparency and accessibility for the housing development process in the greater Boston area so that the public can make informed decisions about where to live and understand the shifting landscape of their city.
